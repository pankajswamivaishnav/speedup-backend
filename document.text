#1 I have created a `catchAsyncHandler` middleware function where we can pass an async function. We won't need to write try-catch blocks repeatedly. If the function runs successfully, it will resolve. If it fails, we'll pass the `next` parameter in the catch block, along with a message and a status code.

#2 Check catchAsyncHandler function in catchAysnc.js file in middleware folder
#3 ErrorHandler Function Utils Folder
